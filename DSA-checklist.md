# ✅ DSA Completion Checklist

Use this checklist to track your mastery of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Mark each item when you have:
- Understood the concept
- Implemented it from scratch
- Solved at least 3–5 practice problems

---

## 1. Arrays & Strings
- [ ] Arrays: basic operations (insert, delete, traversal)
- [ ] Two-Pointer Techniques
- [ ] Sliding Window Techniques
- [ ] String Manipulation (substring, anagrams, palindrome)

## 2. Linked Lists
- [ ] Singly Linked List: insert, delete, reverse
- [ ] Doubly Linked List: insert, delete, reverse
- [ ] Cycle Detection (Floyd’s algorithm)
- [ ] Merge two sorted lists

## 3. Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Stack: push, pop, peek, apply to expression evaluation
- [ ] Queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek, circular queue
- [ ] Monotonic Stack & Sliding Window using Deque

## 4. Hash Maps & Sets
- [ ] Hash Map operations: insert, lookup, delete
- [ ] Collision handling (chaining vs open addressing)
- [ ] Hash Set usage
- [ ] Applications: two-sum, group anagrams

## 5. Trees
- [ ] Binary Tree Traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive & iterative)
- [ ] Level-Order Traversal (BFS)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, search)
- [ ] Balanced Trees (AVL or Red-Black) — theory overview
- [ ] Tree-based problems: lowest common ancestor, tree diameter

## 6. Heaps & Priority Queues
- [ ] Max-Heap & Min-Heap operations
- [ ] Implement heap from array
- [ ] Priority Queue applications: Kth largest, merge k lists

## 7. Graphs
- [ ] Representation: adjacency list & matrix
- [ ] BFS and DFS (recursive & iterative)
- [ ] Shortest Path: Dijkstra’s algorithm
- [ ] Topological Sort
- [ ] Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

## 8. Sorting & Searching
- [ ] Basic Sorts: Bubble, Selection, Insertion
- [ ] Efficient Sorts: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- [ ] Searching: Binary Search (on arrays and in rotated arrays)

## 9. Recursion & Backtracking
- [ ] Basic recursion patterns (factorial, fibonacci)
- [ ] Backtracking templates (combinations, permutations, subsets)
- [ ] N-Queens, Sudoku solver examples

## 10. Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Memoization vs Tabulation
- [ ] 1D DP: Fibonacci, climb stairs, coin change
- [ ] 2D DP: longest common subsequence, knapsack
- [ ] Common patterns: LIS, matrix path problems

## 11. Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Activity Selection
- [ ] Interval Scheduling
- [ ] Huffman Coding concept
- [ ] Fractional Knapsack

## 12. Complexity Analysis
- [ ] Big O, Big Θ, Big Ω notation
- [ ] Time & Space complexity for each DSA topic
- [ ] Amortized analysis (e.g., dynamic array resizing)

## 13. Practice & Review
- [ ] Weekly review of 5 past problems
- [ ] Monthly mock contest (60 mins, 4–6 problems)
- [ ] Maintain a mistake log: record missteps and solutions
